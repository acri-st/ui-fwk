- **Node.js** (version 18.x or higher)
- **Git** 
- **Docker** Docker is mainly used for the test suite, but can also be used to deploy the project via docker compose

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/acri-st/ui-fwk.git
# OR
git clone git@github.com:acri-st/ui-fwk.git
cd ui-fwk
```

## Development

## Development Mode

### Standard local development

Setup environment
```bash
make setup
```

Start the development server:
```bash
make start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8200`

To clean the project and remove node_modules and other generated files, use:
```bash
make clean
```

### Production Build

Build the application for production:
```bash
make build
```
#### Docker local development 
Setup environment
```bash
make setup DEPLOY=docker
```

Start the development server:
```bash
make start DEPLOY=docker
```

Stop the development server:
```bash
make stop DEPLOY=docker
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8200`

To clean the project and remove node_modules and other generated files, use:
```bash
make clean DEPLOY=docker
```

### Production Build

Build the application for production:
```bash
